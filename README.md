## Git working culture

For every updates, DO NOT push directly to `main` branch. Create a new branch, commit, publish branch and create a pull request (PR) instead.
A branch should have prefix features/ for a feature update, prefix hotfixes/ for a hotfix, improvs/ for an improvement ...
A PR should be small enough to review. To split a large PR, use stacked [PRs](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-stacked-pull-requests-in-github/).
